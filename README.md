The WeatherShield1 board
========================

The WeatherShield1 is a shield for Arduino or Netduino boards. It lets you easily create a simple weather station able to read temperature, ambient pressure and relative humidity. The shield is equipped with an on board controller responsible for measuring, averaging and conditioning sampled data and to present them to the user in internationally known units (Celsius, hPa and relative %).
